# Logarithmic-Regression-Calculator
 
## 📌 Project Overview  
Logarithmic Regression Calculator is a mobile application designed to perform **logarithmic regression analysis** for a given set of data points.  
Users can input paired \( (x, y) \) values, and the app will compute the **best-fit logarithmic equation** of the form:

\[
y = a \ln x + b
\]

along with the **correlation coefficient \( r \)**.

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 **Logarithmic Curve Fitting** – Computes the best-fit logarithmic equation.
- 🔢 **Dynamic Data Input** – Enter, update, or delete data points easily.
- 🛠 **Regression Formula Display** – Shows the final logarithmic equation.
- 🎯 **Interactive Interface** – Simple and user-friendly design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Platform:** Android  
- **Languages:** Java
- **UI Framework:** Android XML  
- **Math Libraries:** Custom implementation for statistical calculations
